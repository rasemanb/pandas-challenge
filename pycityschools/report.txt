Pandas Challenge Report

From this analysis, we found that all fifteen schools achieved a passing score (greater than or equal

to 70) for both math and reading. Going into the analysis, I initially thought that Charter schools

may have the edge because of higher funding, but the per school budget and per student budget showed

the majority of District schools had higher budgets. Despite the fact District schools had the higher

budget, Charter schools outscored them in both average reading and average math scores across all

students. The analysis also showed that smaller sized schools (0 to 2000 students) averaged higher

passing rates than the larger schools (2000 to 5000 students). Based off of the scores by school type

section, it is likely that the Charter schools had less students than the District schools. 

Another conclusion we can make is that higher funding does not equal higher performance.
